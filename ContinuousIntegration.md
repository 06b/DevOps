A typical continuous integration workflow will contain:
* Setting up the automated build and unit testing
* Setting up machines for application deployment and testing
* Configuring for application deployment and testing
* Queuing the Build, execute Tests and Test results analysis
* Configuring the whole work flow to execute on a continuous basis


# A Sample Continuous Integration Workflow
* Check in Code
* New Build Is Kicked Off
* Code Is Checked Out
* Code Is Compiled
* Static Analyzers Are Run
* Unit Tests Are Run
* Results Are Reported
* Software Is Packaged
* Code Is Optionally Deployed (Continuous Deployment)
