## Advantages and Disadvantages of Continuous Integration
### These are some of the advantages of continuous integration:
* You catch build breaks early on.
* In a distributed development environment where developers do not always communicate with one another, continuous integration is a great way to assure the developer that the build he or she is building is the latest one.
* Continuous integration also causes less regression
* The feedback loop is smaller.
* A developer does not have to wait for the end of the day or week to find out how the check-in affected the build.
* Integration testing moves up in the chain.
* Every check-in goes through the integration testing where problems are caught early.
* Continuous integration enforces better development processes.
* Each developer is held accountable.
* You always have a latest-and-greatest build to use in demos, showcases, etc.

### On the other hand, there are some disadvantages:
* Maintenance overhead often increases.
* Some teams find that the level of discipline required for continuous integration causes bottlenecks. * This often requires a shift in the developer mindset.
* The immediate impact of a check-in often causes a backup because programmers cannot check in partially completed code.
