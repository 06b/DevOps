What they really mean is: “We pretty much have no Operations capability at all, and we rely on the Developers to build, deploy and manage all of the environments from Development to Test to Production. Mostly by hand. Badly.”

Operations is a discipline, with its own patterns and practices, methodologies, models, tools, technology, etc. Just because modern cloud hosting makes it easier to deploy servers without having to know one end of a SCSI cable from another doesn’t mean you know how to do Operations (just like my knowledge of SQL is enough to find out the information I need to monitor and manage the environment, but a long way from what’s required to develop a complex, high-performing website).

DevOps means Development and Operations working together collaboratively to put the Operations requirements about stability, reliability, performance into the Development practices – while at the same time bringing Development into the management of the Production environment. For example, by putting them on-call, or by leveraging their development skills to help automate key processes.
