Step 1:  Developer checks in code to development branch.

Step 2: Continuous integration server picks up the change, merges it with Master/Trunk/Mainline, performs unit tests and votes on the merge to staging environment based on test results.

Step 3. If Step 2 is successful, developer deploys it to the staging environment and QA tests the environment.

Step 4. If Step 3 passed, you vote to move to production and the continuous integration server picks this up again and determines if itâ€™s ok to merge into production.

Step 5. If Step 4 is successful, it will deploy to production environment.
