# Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

Components of a complete application performance management solution:
* Performance of individual web requests or transactions
* Usage and performance of all application dependencies like databases, web services, caching, etc
* Detailed transaction traces down to specific lines of code
* Code level performance profiling
* Basic server metrics like CPU, memory, etc
* Application framework metrics like performance counters, JMX mBeans, etc
* Custom applications metrics created by the dev team or business
* Application log data
* Application errors
* Real user monitoring

# 3 Types of APM monitoring tools
* **App Metrics based** – Several tools use various server and app metrics and call it APM. At best they can tell you how many requests your app gets and potentially which URLs might be slow. Since they don’t do code level profiling, they can’t tell you why.
* **Code level performance** – Stackify Retrace, New Relic, AppDynamics, and Dynatrace are the typical type of APM products you think of, based on code profiling and transaction tracing.
* **Network based** – Extrahop uses the term APM in regards to their ability to measure application performance based on network traffic. There is a whole product category called NPM that focuses on this type of solutions.

Availability Monitoring
* Monitor whether your application is actually up and running or not.
* Get email notifications when your application is down.

Custom Error Recording
* Create custom error recording and New Relic will record and show the errors in a neat graph for you.
* You can also see Stack trace for each error.

Key Transaction Tracking
* Key transaction monitoring (irrespective of whether it is in model, controller or database, etc.)
* New Relic generally monitors all the transactions; however, it also enables you to track key transactions for a tighter control and understanding of how your application is working / affected when it's in the wild.

External Service Call Recording
* Many applications interact with external services through APIs and other means (eg: API calls to Facebook, Twitter, etc.); New Relic enables you to record and monitor Service Calls.
* Service calls can significantly affect the performance of an application; and External Service Call recording enables you to have this under control by having the right information at hand at the right time.

Scalability and Capability Analysis
* You can do load tests and check if your application is ready for scaling or to handle heavy load when required.
* You can also monitor your applications response time trends and other factors to forecast when you will need to increase capacity, etc.

Key Features and Benefits of Mainframe Application Performance Management

* Improve user code efficiency, transaction response time and throughput.
* Locate and improve resource-consumptive database calls.
* Quickly pinpoint the source of application inefficiencies.
* Identify SQL statements and DB2 system services that cause excessive CPU time or wait time.
* Receive detailed DB2 tuning information including catalog statistics and the number of GET PAGE requests for each SQL statement.
* Enable new users to be more productive with a graphical interface for taking measurements and detecting mainframe application performance problems.
* Launch Strobe directly from BMC’s MainView or Cost Analyzer for zEnterprise to quickly and easily identify tuning opportunities that will have the greatest impact on monthly software licensing costs




* **Application Availability* - On an average, one hour of downtime costs businesses $474,000 in lost revenue. eG Enterprise helps you to monitor, pre-emptively detect and quickly resolve application issues. This way, you can prevent downtime and ensure great performance and user satisfaction and save your business tons of money.
* **Migration* - When application infrastructures are migrated, the key acceptance criteria is user experience. eG Enterprise helps you benchmark performance before and after migration. Comparing key metrics across the two scenarios, you can identify problems introduced during migration and fix them quickly.
* **Cost Reduction* - Many a times, hardware is added indiscretely in a bid to solve performance problems. This results in cost overruns and stalls IT transformation initiatives. eG Enterprise helps you identify bottlenecks, maximize resource utilization and reduce hardware and software costs and to right-size your IT infrastructure.
* **Scaling Rollouts* - IT managers are looking for ways to scale their infrastructure – to support more users, new workloads, etc. eG Enterprise’s historical reporting and predictive analytics help identify bottlenecks in the infrastructure. Thus, you can determine where to make investments to allow the infrastructure to scale.
* **Operational Efficiency* - By making it possible to diagnose problems with one click, eG Enterprise empowers helpdesk personnel to manage and troubleshoot performance issues. This way, organizations can significantly reduce their IT operations costs.
* **Compliance Tracking* - Track user logins, access durations and application usage for compliance reporting. Alert on exceptions for immediate remediation. Detect and report history of configuration changes and cross-correlate with performance degradations.
* **Performance Optimization* - As IT infrastructures become software-defined, adding more hardware only alleviates performance problems temporarily. With visibility into the performance of every layer, every tier of the infrastructure, you can determine how to optimally utilize the current infrastructure investments to do more.
* **Release Preparedness * - Prior to release, get the diagnostics and actionable intelligence you need to eliminate any bottleneck areas. Immediately after deployment, get the deep visibility and insights you need to troubleshoot and resolve new issues that come up.

Monitor the health of your computer infrastructure or application

Application have traditionally been delivered from servers and data centers, so the performance monitoring has focused on data center infrastructure, however the delivery chain for todays applications involves an increasingly complex data center, multi-tier, application architectures and an expanding mix of cloud services, third parties, CDNs, ISPs, mobile browsers and devices. 

The above raises two issues. 
* First the help that the infrastructure is no longer the only determinant of the performance the end user is seeing, which is the only perspective that really counts for business critical applications. 
* Second, when you learn about a poorly performing application, how long does it take your production development team to reproduce the problem, find the root cause and fix it.

Application Performance Monitoring Software has a task to become a service in your company that monitors computer infrastructure and application health. It collects various diagnostic data, such as performance metrics, event logs and traces.


Use cases for Application Performance Monitoring
It is crucial to use the Application Performance Monitoring Software to identify issues anywhere along the chain of a web server, cloud provider, content delivery network, mobile carriers or script problem in a browser. The average time to repair a failed component of the application reflects on the cost whether the application is in a production or under development. In order to gain more happy end-users and faster time to market, teams need to get immediate failure notifications and approach the problem as quick as possible.

We have to keep in mind that Development and IT operations have different goals. Development is driven by needs for frequent delivery of new features, where IT is usually focused on availability, stability and cost efficiency. This of course has a serious business impact for example – loss of efficiency, reduced agility and customer dissatisfaction. A good Application Performance Monitoring platform should be able to cover the most of the components in Application Lifecycle. It should help both teams to increase efficiency and agility, monitor, troubleshoot, provide detailed app monitoring in production and integrate with the developer environment.

Overall, Application Performance Management Software can be understood as the combination of tools that help in measurement and optimization of applications and systems used by software developers in their development, production and business processes.
